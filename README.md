### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**gtmsakhiya/gtmsakhiya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ios app devlopment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning objective C, swift for app devlopment.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also work for VBScript, AppleScript and python for fun and automating tasks and controlling all apps.
