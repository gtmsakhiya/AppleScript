### Hi there 👋

<!--
**gtmsakhiya/gtmsakhiya** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ios app devlopment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning objective C, swift for app devlopment.
- 🤔 I’m also work for VBScript, AppleScript and python for fun and automating tasks and controlling all apps.
